API
===

Polemarch provides REST API for all it's functionality accessible via web GUI,
because our GUI also uses this API to work. Below there is an information about every
entity we have in Polemarch and methods applicable to it.

This is an example of api schema, but you can find actual schema on Polemarch host at
``/api/v2/openapi/``.
